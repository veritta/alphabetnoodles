                I pour the memory of your laugh into a bottle and knock
                it back like vodka. I hate vodka, but it does the trick,
                and in much the same fashion I find my throat burning for
                a few searing moments, before my head fills up with cotton
                wool and I feel just disconnected enough from it all. I
                wipe your smile from my lips and wash it down the drain,
                spitting out the last of your kisses as I watch the colours
                ooze across the ceramic of the sink, white like the whites
                of your wide eyes, white like the void you painted onto my
                skin. The feeling of time itches like a poorly-made coat
                and I shrug it off, shedding your touch and the shape of
                your name, leaving it spooled like snakeskin on the floor
                where you last lay in my arms.

              <p>
                It starts like a caffeine buzz, like anxiety gnawing away
                at your stomach, like something crawling over your skin,
                and it’s just like limerence, you feel so sick but you also
                feel good, heady with anticipation, vision shimmering, every
                nerve alight with potential.
              </p>
              <p>
                It pulls you in like eye contact with your crush, and with
                so much and so little warning &mdash; you knew this was coming,
                but it’s always a ride &mdash; it consumes you, painting your
                insides anew.
              </p>
              <p>
                The world is brighter and the edges not so defined, and
                everything is moving, everything is alive, and now it feels
                like the entirety of human existence is on your side, that
                the whole cosmically hilarious black humour of life has been
                worth it, just for these moments &mdash; minutes &mdash; hours
                &mdash; or was
                it seconds?
              </p>
              <p>
                And yes, you’ll wake the next day with naught but memories,
                but that’s all life is in the end, nothing but memories &mdash;
                nothing but memories, and the ability to see something that
                you didn’t before.
